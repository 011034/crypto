# crypto
This Python-based tool offers a straightforward graphical interface for encrypting and decrypting files using the AES-based Fernet encryption mechanism from the cryptography library. By leveraging a simple yet effective key management system, users can easily generate, load, and save encryption keys. The toolâ€™s GUI, built with Tkinter, allows users to browse their system for files to encrypt or decrypt and save the resulting output at a specified location. This ensures a user-friendly workflow that does not require command-line operations. While not intended for large-scale or high-security enterprise environments, this application provides a clear and accessible starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of file encryption and decryption in a Python ecosystem.
